??? This is a test file for the trainer. where we will test the trainer our model.
#For the next line we will test the trainer wih a simple model.
@As we know that the model is a transfor mode. 

Artificial Intelligence (AI) models are designed to learn from data, 
which is the foundation for their ability to make decisions, 
predictions, or classifications. 
The process of training an AI model involves feeding it large amounts of data, 
allowing it to learn patterns, and then testing it to see how well it performs. 
In this essay, we will discuss the concepts of datasets, model training, 
teaching, and testing, and explain how these steps contribute to the development of an AI system.
